demo PR for schedulerkbtu

This is a small placeholder file added to validate the Pull Request workflow (branching, CI, PR creation and merge) for the schedulerkbtu repository.

Project context (short):
- frontend: React + Vite (TypeScript), components for scheduling, course management, and UI (see `frontend/src/components`).
- backend: Express + Prisma + Playwright for scraping and APIs (see `backend/src`, `prisma/`).

Why this PR exists:
- Simple, minimal change to exercise repository CI and PR process before doing real feature work .

How to validate locally:
1. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev — verify dev server starts and builds.
2. Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run dev — verify server starts and endpoints respond.
3. Run lint/build: cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run build. Backend: npm run build.

Follow-ups (what to actually implement after this demo):
- Add a small frontend UI tweak to `ScheduleComparison` to address X (placeholder).
- Add an endpoint in backend to expose aggregated schedule stats.
